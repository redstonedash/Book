# Book
a open source story

this is a story made with the intention of becoming one of the longest books of all time. The story starts with an event known as the "Awakaning" where people begin to become arbratrary creatures.

entries into the book do not need to connect to any other story, infact most wont. the idea is to create several short stories that fit into the setting.

contributions are expected to be consistent with the greater whole of the story, this means that any inconsistencies found will be added to a seperate branch and removed from the main branch until they are made consistent.

anyone is welcome to participate.
